GROUP 11: Emily Kim, Liam Perry, Tiffany Tran

How to use our website (without having to make your own domain):

Launch Visual Studio Code (or any other coding app, but we only have instructions for VS Code as that's what we used).

Open this folder in VS Code.

In VS Code, there should be a “Go Live” button at the bottom right corner of the application. Click it.

If you do not have the extension installed to host your code on a local domain, you can download this extension in VS Code for free. 

After clicking Go Live, your default browser should automatically open a tab to our homepage.

To navigate to individual pages, click any of the group members’ names (they are captions to the pictures of each group member). This will take you to the corresponding group member’s individual page.

When you want to go back to the homepage, there is a button at the bottom (or near the bottom) of each group member’s individual page that says “Back to Homepage”. Click it, and you will be returned to the homepage.

Thank you!
